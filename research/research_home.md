### Theoretical Neuroscience
To me, neuroscience's importance in the 21st century is like the DNA to the 20th century. We humans have grasped a good understanding on various subjects such as materials, architecture and sounds. Sadly, we have failed to understand where all these understandings come from, the brain. The research on brain have been accelerated with the appearance advanced instruments that allow us to observe the brain activities in non-invasive ways. I think it is important to for us to know about ourselves first before we tackle other difficult problems and my primary interests lay in human intelligence and the formation of memory.

* [Intelligence](/research/intelligence.pdf): Some thoughts I had after reading Jeff Hawkins' On Intelligence. I compared the intelligence that Turing proposes and the one of Hawkins.


### Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)
* [Semantic TeX](https://github.com/KWARC/sTeX) (sTeX): sTeX is my very first research project. Ever since the first semester in college, I have been working with professor Michael Kohlhase and one of his lovely PhD students Deyan Ginev at KWARC group. Involvement in sTeX has taught me a lot on both the theoretical ground and the implementation ground. To put it a simple way, MathML, OpenMath and OMDoc are machine-friendly formats for math so that the machines can do search, automated proving and cross-referencing easily. TeX is the main driving horse for high quality mathematics documents authoring. A variant of TeX that allows for structural formats, enables us to transform those documents into OMDoc with the help of [LaTeXML sTeX plugin](https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeXML-Plugin-sTeX) to let machines operate on the documents.

### Data Science
* [Statistic with R](/r/r_home): During my time working as a student assistant for professor Adalbert Wilhelm. We compiled a list of tutorials for intro stats courses at Jacobs university. This tutorial series covers a wide range of topics ranging from primitive data types to text mining. The repo is still under development. The tutorials are host on [Github](https://github.com/angerhang/statsTutorial). Any feedbacks or contributions are welcome.

* [Data visualization](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/about-the-institute/facilities/kpmg-data-observatory-/): Currently, I am working in the KPMG Data Observatory (KDO) at Imperial College London. KDO has 64 HD displays in a panoramic view with full range audio system. As counter intuitive as it might seem, the core of KDO is to present the detailed resolution while maintain the general pattern of different visualizations because normally when we do visualization, we use reductionist's approach by eliminating the noises and reducing the complexities of the data sets so to make the visualizations fit our PC screens. In KDO, it is doing the exactly appositive, trying to understand whether the visualizations at a larger scale and at a better resolution are able reveal more insights about the data available.
