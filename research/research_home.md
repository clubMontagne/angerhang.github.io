[Undergraduate Research 101](/blog/undergraduate_research): is a guide for undergraduate students who would like to know how to get started with research.

### Theoretical Neuroscience
To me, neuroscience's importance in the 21st century is like that of the DNA to the 20th century. We humans have grasped a good understanding on many subjects already. Sadly, we have failed to understand where all these understandings come from, the brain. The research on brain have been accelerated with the appearance of advanced instruments that allow us to observe the brain activities in both invasive and non-invasive ways. I think it is important to for us to know about ourselves first before we tackle other difficult problems and my primary interests lay in human intelligence and using the understanding of brain signals let us more ways to interact with the outside world and with each other via Brain-Computer-Interfaces.

#### Echo State Networks (ESNs)
ESNs are a type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that are easy to train but still maintain the power of capturing the temporal information that do. In my bachelor thesis, I was able to construct ESNs for motor learning skill classification on EEG data. Additionally, I also developed new methods on how to increase the interpabiltiy of ESNs. My thesis can be found [here](/extra/thesis.pdf). 


#### Related work
* [Facial Verifier](/resources/cv_poster.pdf): This is a computer vision project that I did with two other fiends at CMU. Basically we built a facial verifier using ConvNets and joint-Bayesian methods. We were able to achieve good performance that was comparable to the stats mentioned in the relevant papers.

* [Intelligence](/research/intelligence.pdf): Some thoughts I had after reading Jeff Hawkins' On Intelligence. I compared the intelligence that Turing proposes and the one of Hawkins.


### Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)
* [Semantic TeX](https://github.com/KWARC/sTeX) (sTeX): sTeX is my very first research project. Ever since the first semester in college, I have been working with professor Michael Kohlhase and one of his lovely PhD students Deyan Ginev at KWARC group. Involvement in sTeX has taught me a lot on both the theoretical ground and the implementation ground. To put it a simple way, MathML, OpenMath and OMDoc are machine-friendly formats for math so that the machines can do search, automated proving and cross-referencing easily. TeX is the main driving horse for high quality mathematics documents authoring. A variant of TeX that allows for structural formats, enables us to transform those documents into OMDoc with the help of [LaTeXML sTeX plugin](https://github.com/KWARC/LaTeXML-Plugin-sTeX) to let machines operate on the documents.

### Data Science
* [Statistics with R](/r/r_home): During my time working as a student assistant for professor Adalbert Wilhelm. We compiled a list of tutorials for intro stats courses at Jacobs university. This tutorial series covers a wide range of topics ranging from primitive data types to text mining. The repo is still under development. The tutorials are host on [Github](https://github.com/angerhang/statsTutorial). Any feedbacks or contributions are welcome.

* [Data visualization](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/about-the-institute/facilities/kpmg-data-observatory-/): In the summer of 2016, I worked as a research intern at the KPMG Data Observatory (KDO) at Imperial College London. KDO has 64 HD displays in a panoramic view with full range audio system. As counter-intuitive as it might seem, the core of KDO is to present the detailed resolution while maintain the general pattern of different visualizations at the same time. Contrast to the reductionist's approach which eliminats the noises and reduces the complexities of the data sets so to make the visualizations fit our PC screens. In KDO, it is doing the exactly appositive, trying to understand the data from visualizations at a larger scale and at a better resolution.
