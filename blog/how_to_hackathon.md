title: Yet another guide to Hackathon
---

After winning two hackathons in Berlin (HPI Data Analytics and Machine Learning Hack) and in London (Open Bank Project HacK) this summer, I think it's about the time to write an article about hackathon. I will cover:

* [What is a hackathon?] (#topic1)
* [How can I attend a hackathon?] (#topic2)
* [How can I win a hackathon?] (#topic3)
* [What should I do after a hackathon?] (#topic4)

###  <a name="topic1"></a> What is a hackathon?
If you are reading my blog, you probably already have a vague idea of what a hackathon is - a marathon like event for hackers to build awesome projects over a short period of time. A hackathon can last from a day to a week, a hackathon can have a specific theme or allow you to build anything you want and a hackathon can have from ten-ish to over one thousand participants. 

For the first timers, going to a hackathon might sound intimidating especially when you don't much (yet). Sometimes, you just have to make yourself uncomfortable to learn quicker. My first hackathon was JacobsHack at my home university when I one month after I started college. With some web development (mainly HTML+CSS) and a little more than AP computer science level Java, I dived straight into helping building a [Scala web framework](https://github.com/widok/widok). To be honest, I didn't contribute much, but the learning environment is absolutely superb. During that weekend, I did my first Github commits to the project that was not mine, I did my first terminal commands and did my first pitch for a coding project and many other firsts. Oh I also forgot that was the first time I stayed up all night to work on a coding project : > (A skill that hackers must learn)

Yes in a hackathon, typically you will be working as a team and there are different roles in a team. You could either be a lead coder who helps out less experienced ones or you could be a newbie trying to learn everything on the fly. Either way you will learn a lot. For former makes you a better communicator and a group leader and the latter makes you a better coder and a problem solver under stress.

You should also be aware that there are different kinds of hackathons out there. There are the ones that allow you to build whatever you want and there are the ones that have specific theme you will need to follow. 

### <a name="topic2"></a> How can I attend a hackathon?
Going to a hackathon is most of the time easy. There are several types of registration processes: admission based, random draft, and first come first serve. For the larger and better organized hackathons, they typically will require you to fill in some kind of application forms so that they can have a diverse group of people, but in general, the organizers make it very easy to register. To find what hackathons are out there, you can simply look through these webistes:

* [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io)
* [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com)
* [Hackalist](http://www.hackalist.org) 

One nice thing about being a hacker is, the big hackathons will try to cover your travel costs, food and accommodation. Is there anything better than free stuff? (Please email me if you know the answer) So do look through the FAQs when you register. 

Of course there are plenty of notably Hackathons that have good atmosphere and organization. Going to any one of them won't disappoint you. The following is just a list that comes across my mind:

* [PennApps](http://2016f.pennapps.com): the first student-run college hackathon.
* [MITHack](https://hackmit.org): how can you get more geeky than MIT and it even has a puzzle that people can solve to ensure their spots every year.
* [OxfordHack](http://www.oxfordhack.com): hacking in one of the oldest universities is a good experience.
* [JacobsHack](https://2016f.jacobshack.com): an ultra international hackathon the largest student-run hackathon in Germany.

These hackathons are all popular and are all application based. So if you want to go to one of the above, you'd better plan your trip several months earlier.


###  <a name="topic3"></a> How can I win a hackathon?
Although learning is the most important thing in participating in a hackathon, it doesn't hurt if you can also win something along the way. To me winning a hackathon means two things: having a half-baked project and having a good team. Let me explain why these two things are important.

##### A half-baked project is the key
Oftentimes, we hear business people say, `I have an idea, but I just need someone to implement it.` I always raise a red flag for this statement before go any further. Especially for an event like hackathon where you don't get much time to think through your ideas. Even if you have a fantastic idea, but you might later find out, it is technically impossible, but spending time debating over project ideas can be costly given the limited amount of the time you have.

A half-baked project can be something that has been partially implemented before the hackathon and all you need to do is to finish the rest. It could also be a throughly research project idea that is possible and within the time frame, one can build a functional prototype. In the end, each team is supposed to present its idea to the judges and nothing is more convicing than a functional prototype.

##### The team chemistry will make the magic happen
Once you know what you want to build, you will probably want to have a small group of people that you can work with. It is important to have people of different expertise on the team so in the end, you can have a well balanced project to present.

More importantly you want to have fun. What I usually do is to attend those pre-opening sessions and join the online group chats in advance, primacy to hunt down people that I think I can work with. Maybe one or two other teammates of yours are not the best coders, but they perhaps are very energetic and can pomp up the spirit when the hack has been long. In addition, having someone who you can have agreements with gain you more time in doing the work and merely debating over what matters and what not.

Lastly make sure to practice your pitch before the presentation. I know you might just want to finish up that one single feature before everything ends and I know you are really close to get something done, but when it comes to presentation you want to have rehearsed the pitch at least three time beforehand for two reasons. 

First, you only have a limited amount of time, if you don't practice you don't really know how much you can cover and there are teams who have built something great but run out of the time for their demos which is a pity.

Second, you want to impress the judges. Not many people will actually look at your code base and evaluate how good your code is and thus all the judges know about is what you tell them during the several minutes presentation. 

###  <a name="topic4"></a> What should I do after a hackathon?
Make sure to exchange contact info with the people whose work you admire and the ones that you might collaborate with in the future. I found it particularly fun to engage more with those people who are excited about technology and who share similar mindset and stay connected afterwards.

Also, the project you build over a hackathon might have lots of hacky code. If you want to work on it more, remember to optimize and make better documentations. Put it on Github and let more people know about your work.

Finally I want to say going to a hackathon is a great way for learning and make connections. You might not win prizes all the time, but the experience is always rewarding.
