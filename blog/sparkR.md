title: SparkR tutorials
---

Spark is one of the sexiest tool that is used for big data processing and R is the language
of many data analysts as well. SparkR is a good combination of these two great things, however
there aren't that many tutorials online yet, which serves as the primary motivation of this tutorial series.

So far, I have written two basic tutorials and more is on the way.

* [Linear and logistic regressions](/blog/sparkR/regressions.html)

This work is done under the supervision of Adalbert F. X. Wilhelm at Jacobs University.
