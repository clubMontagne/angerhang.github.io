title: Where do we, the third-culture-kids, really belong?

Today was a day that I have experienced most sense of lonliness during recent years. While
I am feeling depressed at this very momenet, I feel the need to note down the feelings in words 
as both a breakpoint and an awaking call for us, the third-culture-kids (TCKs), who have spent
 an extended period of our lives in a country or culture that is different from the one in which
 we were born, and to finally raise more attention on the always-bothering quesition, where we
 really belong? 
 
 This summer, I am conducting a research internship in Max Planck Insititue in Tuebingen, a small
 town in Southern Germany. Max Planck has world-class research in brain-computer-interfaces and 
 machine learning areas, and that's the primary reason why chose to come here. I did my undergraduate 
 degree in Jacobs University Bremen, and had a wonderful time there so I thought it wouldn't have a problem
 settling down in Tuebingen, just another German city right? 
 However, what I didn't realize was how disconnected I was with the environment that I was living in until today.
 
 I have always been a big fan of classical music and been playing clarinet in orchestra for a few years. So 
 I would seize any opportunity to attend a classical music. There is this beatiful cathedral in front 
 of the place I live in and today I heard sounds of symphony coming around after I came back home. I thought
 that would be nothing of a big deal because it's normal to have orchestras rehearse in a church for its
 accustics until I heard interminable clapping and people in fancy dress. That was a momement that I realized
 I was even not aware of a concernt happening ten meters away from my house, and even if I have found out
 about the concert, I wouldn't have anyone that I could have gone with. Deep in my heart, I was asking what's wrong with me? Having been here almost two months, but still no one to go out with? 
 
 Then I started to reflect on my previous moves to differnet places, when I first moved to Los Angeles for High School, then Jacobs for college, Imperial College in London for internship and Pittsbugh for study aboard..... I suddenly realized I was always in this utopian world (school/university) where people are meant to get to know more people and be open-minded about things because in school we are learning, whereas in real world, everyone has a nine-to-five job and wants to relax during liesure time. No one would actively go out to meet new people like in school. One friend of mine suggedted me using internations a community for expatriates like us to get connected, but since Tuebingen is rather small, there is no active group around. Even people from Max Planck, a quite international crowd, feel more like colleagues than classmates who we will just hang out over the weekends. It's also shameful for me to say that even after spending three years in Germany and having obtained a German degree, my German skills are barely enough for me to make any proper conversation. I believe there are many people who are in the same shoes, as we move around often and on one is going to learn all the local lanagues wherever he moves to. Then the question is, how do we, the TCKs, get involved with the envrionment that we live in and how do we avoid situation that I had today? 
 
 Many of us feel the same way that, we are always looking forward to going to home, but when we are home, there is disappointing because the people who have stayed in the same place do not understand what we have seen, so they wouldn't appreciate your stories as much. At the same time, when we move to another country, getting to all the new things, we still won't have a sense a belonging either we look different or we think different with the locals that even after a long-period of residency, a sense of attachment has emerged but one would still not call the that place home. 
 
 To me, the answer is, maybe we, TCKs, don't have a physical home that we feel absolutely home because our home is always on the way, at this very momenet that we live in. The true culture of our kind resides in the people who are also TCKs. Even though different TCKs have lived in different places, but the experiences of moving around and having to deal with all the transitions and experinces all those novel things in the new country is shared by us all. That's why I have made up my mind to conduct my doctoral study in an international cities where there will be more people who are TCKs. I am not saying staying in a small town for a really long time isn't good. People just have diffrent ways of livings. We are indeed priviaged to have the opportunites to travel around, but we should not feel superior.
