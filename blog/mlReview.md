Continuing my adventure on machine learning and MOOCs, I decided to take Stanford's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) taught by Andrew Ng. This course is the starting
point of many people's machine learning career. It covers a wide variety of topics ranging from simple regressions to more
advanced techniques such as neural networks and support vector machines.

Although this course does not involve lots of mathematical proofs, it gives me a very good intuition of how things work.
This course is composed of video lectures, and weekly quizzes and programming assignments. I found it easy to do well
in quizzes after watching all the video lectures and going over the lecture notes on the Course Wiki. As for the programming
assignments, each assignment is implementation of the concept explained in that week and I really enjoyed doing
those assignments, because most of the frameworks have already been setup, and I only need to put the mathematical formulae
into Matlab scripts. I admit that machine learning is a lot more than just implementing the mathematical formulae, however, for
neophytes, this way of teaching is more rewarding as it is easier for me at least to see the big picture of how everything comes
along.

 
I ended up getting 99.6% for the course and I think this course is manageable for anyone who has some first year college math
and programming background, albeit those those would help and are not necessary since Ng tries to explain everything from ground up.
I would definitely recommend anyone who want to study machine learning to take this course.

Follow up: after completing this course, I got to know a few people from the study group and we are participating in Kaggle competition to
apply our machine learning knowledge at the meantime, I am also taking the machine learning specialization from University of Washington,
my first two courses will be on Case Study and Regressions. I will also write about my experiences in taking machine learning specialization
in the future.
