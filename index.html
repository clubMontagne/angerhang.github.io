  <hr>


  I am a master student at <a href="https://epfl.ch">EPFL</a> originally from China. I study <b>machine learning</b> and apply those techniques in brain sciences research. I just finished my bachelor thesis with Herbert Jaeger and Benn Godde on EEG classification using Echo State Neural Network at <a href="https://www.jacobs-university.de">Jacobs University</a>. Right now I am doing a summer internship
  at <a href="http://brain-computer-interfaces.net">Max Planck Tuebingen for Intelligent Systems group </a> with Dr. Moritz Grosse-Wentrup on transfer learning of brain-computer-interfaces. <br><br>

  I strive to understand some important aspects about the <b>brain</b> and think about how to use brain sciences studies to create real-world applications especially in the areas of <b>brain-computer-interfaces</b> and <b>human-like intelligence</b>. <br><br>

  I strongly believe that in the coming decades, the fundamental research from neuroscience
  can be readily applicable to many much-needed applications that can change the lives of many.
  Therefore, I plan to launch my own company eventually to facilitate this upcoming technological revolution.
