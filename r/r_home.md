This collection of tutorials is made for the statistics support center at Jacobs University. See the repo [here](https://github.com/angerhang/statsTutorial). If you find any mistake or want to contribute, you are very welcome to open up an issue and point it out : )

I will be updating on a weekly basis.

#### Chapter I
* [Basics](/statsWithR/tutorials/basics.html)

* [Data import](/statsWithR/tutorials/dataImport.html)

* [RMySQL](/statsWithR/tutorials/mySQL.html) An interface between MySQL and R.

* [Data Operations and Plotting](/statsWithR/tutorials/dataOp.html)

#### Chapter II Regression
* [Simple Linear Regression I](https://angerhang.shinyapps.io/linearR/)

* [Simple Linear Regression II](/statsWithR/tutorials/linearR_2.html)

#### Chapter III Statistical Inference 
* [Statistical Testing](/statsWithR/tutorials/statsTests.html)

* [ANOVA](/statsWithR/tutorials/anova.html)

##### Text mining
Part of my job at stats support is to explore the R packages that are related
to text mining so here we go:

* [Text mining overview](/statsWithR/tutorials/textMining.html)
A brief introduction on what can we do with R for text mining tasks.

* [Introduction to text mining package](/statsWithR/tutorials/textMiningIntro.html)
We dive into the text mining infrastructure of text mining in R and
have a focus on the use of package `tm`. 

* [Introduction to TwitteR](/statsWithR/tutorials/twitterR.html) A fun package that gives us access to Twitter's web API. We will do a naive analysis on Donald Trump's popularity in the end.

* [Webmining](/statsWithR/tutorials/webMining.html) Use `tm.plugin.webmining` package to retrieve feeds from the web.

* [RText](/statsWithR/tutorials/rtext.html) A package that contains 9 common supervised learnings such as SVM and neural network as a start-to-product tool. Great for prototyping and experimenting.

### For data guru
I have also composed something for Rhadoop and SparkR last semester. If you are keen to big data. These might be a good start.

##### SparkR
* [Intro-to-SparkR](/sparkR/intro)

* [Linear and logistic regressions](/sparkR/regressions)


##### Rhadoop
* [Basics](https://github.com/angerhang/hadoopAndR)
